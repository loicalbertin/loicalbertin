## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm LoÃ¯c

I'm mostly a software engineer specialized in backend development. I have 15+ years of professional experience as software developer.

I'm passionate about complex distributed systems & ðŸ’“ open source.

I have a strong background in Java development but now my heart and soul belong to Go.

At work I currently focus on development on top of Kubernetes (specially with federated distributed clusters) while at home I'm currently exploring multiple blockchain related things.

My personal objective is to learn something new everyday.
