## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm LoÃ¯c

I'm mostly a software engineer specialized in backend development. I have 15+ years of professional experience as software developer.

I'm passionate about complex distributed systems & I ðŸ’“ open source.

I have a strong background in Java development but now my heart and soul belong to Go.

I also have skills in frontend dev (Angular, React, TypeScript, ...) but I'm not the kind of guy that will spend hours in looking for the correct shade of blue for a button... 

At work I currently focus on development on top of Kubernetes (specially with federated distributed clusters) while at home I'm currently exploring multiple blockchain related things.

My personal objective is to learn something new everyday.
